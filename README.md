The AdditionPractice servlet is designed to provide users with an addition practice exercise. It generates two random numbers, presents the addition problem to the user, and checks if the user's input is correct. The user can submit their answer through a form, and the servlet responds with feedback on the correctness of the answer.

The servlet is designed to be deployed on a servlet container, and in this case, it's integrated with Tomcat v9.0. Tomcat v9.0 is an open-source servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation, and it implements the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Expression Language (EL) technologies.

To run/download:
The @WebServlet("/AdditionPractice") annotation indicates that this servlet will be accessible at the specified URL ("/AdditionPractice").
