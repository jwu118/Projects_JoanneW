Summary:
AdditionPractice.java is a Java Servlet which combines random number generation, form submission, and result validation to create a basic web page for practicing addition. Users can input their answers, receive feedback on correctness, and retry if needed.

More DETAILS:
  The AdditionPractice servlet is designed to provide users with an addition practice exercise. AdditionPractice.java is a webpage that allows users to practice or test their mathematical skills relating to addition. 
  It generates two random numbers between 0 and 9 using the 'Random' class, presenting the addition problem to the user, and checks if the user's input is correct. The user can submit their answer through a form, and the servlet responds with feedback on the correctness of the answer.
  The servlet is designed to be deployed on a servlet container, and in this case, it's integrated with Tomcat v9.0. Tomcat v9.0 is an open-source servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation, and it implements the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Expression Language (EL) technologies.

WEB PAGE output:
This servlet generates HTML content to be displayed in the response, including the addition problem and the user's result.

Technical details:
Requires a IDE, installation of TomCat Server v9.0, HTTP GET/POST Request Handling, random number generation, form submission, result validation, and Java.
