#Health Diagnosis (Cancer & Heart Diagnosis) using Machine Learning Algorithms

The codes provided showcase the practical examples of implementing machine learning algorithms for classification tasks and demonstrate key steps in the data preprocessing and evaluation process for cancer and heart diagnosis.

About CancerDiagnosis.ipynb: Uses scikit-learn to perform classification tasks on a cancer dataset: https://github.com/mpourhoma/CS4661/raw/master/Cancer.csv and assigns it to a Pandas DataFrame. It incorporates the Decision Tree classifier to predict cancer based on the training/testing datasets and calcuates and reports the accuracy.

About HeartDiagnosis.ipynb: Uses the Heart dataset from https://github.com/mpourhoma/CS4661/raw/master/Heart_short.csv to train a Logistic Regression classifier, compute accuracy, and plot the ROC Curve with AUC (AKA Area Under Curve). It involves the Logistic Regression classifier alogrithm to predict the heart disease occurance based on the training/testing datasets.

To run/download: Download the two files and run it on any IDE (ex. VS Code, preferably Jupyter Notebook).
